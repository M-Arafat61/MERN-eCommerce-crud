#### I have used `Express.js` `firebase` `Mongodb` `node` & `React` for the project. Below I'm explaining core features of my project.

- # Project features

### 1. Adding product info in _`Mongodb`_ & storing it also showing product to the client side. Only a registered user will be able to add product.

### 2. From a specific product of any brand, product info can be updated. For _`updating a product info`_ also modifying it into database user must have to be registered also logged in.

- #### _`I have included 6 brands for the project, to modify/update any product brand name must contain no space before/after brand name also brands name starts with capital letter.`_

### 3. _`Email, Password & google`_ Authentication with firebase.

### 4. From any brands product details, clicking `add to cart` stores that product info to database. From _my cart page_ `added products of database` has showed in client side.

### 5. In the cart page, _added products can be removed_. With removing the product from cart also delete that specific product data from database.
